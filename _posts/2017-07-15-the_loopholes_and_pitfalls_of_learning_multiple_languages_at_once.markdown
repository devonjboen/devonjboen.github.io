Growing up, I was fascinated with learning languages, and I started learning Spanish early. I studied it throughout school and then after high school, I studied on my own. I enjoyed so much trying to figure out how to fully communicate in a form that wasn’t native to me. 
What was great about Spanish was that it is relatively easy to learn. Many words crossover into English and sentence structure isn’t totally alien. But, just as you would get confident, you’d realize there was a major difference. For example, instead of saying “Dave’s house” you’d say “the house of Dave.” That’s something to get used to for sure. Also, objects and things in Spanish use gendered definite articles. For example, the girl is “la chica” while the boy is “el nino.”
There are many loopholes in Spanish as well as many obstacles for the English learner. It is easy to let your previous knowledge get in the way of what you’re trying to learn. 
I found this exact phenomenon happening with me when I was learning Ruby. I had started the bootcamp prep prior to learning Ruby and I began with JavaScript. JS is quite a bit harder to learn in my opinion so I was used to struggling through labs and looking for hints where there were none. Every little thing had to be perfectly in place and it wasn’t always clear what that place was. 
When I started learning Ruby, I realized learning some JS helped in a lot of ways because JS is more complicated, but there are similarities to Ruby. I’d felt as if I’d mastered Mandarin and now had to learn the easiest language in existence. 
Methods were like functions! They both used conditionals! I already know how to do this! Yeah, those thoughts didn’t last long. Although Ruby is easier, I found myself getting in my own way because I was subconsciously going back to JS in my mind to try and solve problems in Ruby. 
For example, on the While and Until Loops Lab where we had to increase our levitation force to 10 (Harry Potter-themed lab, which I loved) from six, I struggled with this for a long time. Why? Because I was trying to force an argument into the method so we could use ANY starting number. I did that because what I had learned so far in JavaScript indicated that functions were meant to abstract things. They allowed us to do so many different things. 
When my tests kept failing, I realized they weren’t asking me to create a method for ANY number. They had already told me the number. Six. That’s when I realized I didn’t even need an argument. That is when it struck me that I can’t just jump to a different language to fix something in my current language. While one language can be a good resource for another, you have to be able to take a step back and ask if you’re painting yourself into a corner. 
After that, I have been much more careful to look at new solutions and new angles while still benefiting from my other knowledge.
