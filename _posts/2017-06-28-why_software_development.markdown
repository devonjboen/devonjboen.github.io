In my life, I have always pursued mental stimulation. My first and foremost passion is writing. I haven written since I could hold a pencil and haven’t stopped. I earned a degree in English with an emphasis on creative writing, and I continue to write to this day. What intrigued me about writing is that it is a meticulous craft but also endlessly creative. Yes, you have to do certain things to ensure quality, but then your mind can take over and lead you in all kinds of new directions. 

I think these same traits drew me to software development. I started to learn coding on a whim. I thought it might be interesting, so I tried a few free resources. Within two days, I was hooked. I wanted to learn anything and everything I could. 

I spent hours staring at the computer screen trying different variations of code and re-running tests until they finally passed. I believe some people who try coding can’t stand the frustration of constantly trying to fix what’s broken. But I love that frustration. I love the mental challenge. Every line of code that doesn’t work is like a riddle. 

So, there is clearly precision involved in software development, much like writing, but there is also immense creativity involved. Not all problems have one solution. You have to think outside the box. And software development doesn’t just allow you to fix things, it allows you create something entirely from scratch that you and others can use. 

I started teaching myself basic HTML and CSS right away and made a mock website for a burger joint. I just couldn’t wait. I wanted to see something tangible. Every time something showed up on the screen as expected, I was giddy. I love watching something come to fruition piece by piece. I love watching a small change in code fix a problem I’ve been struggling with for hours. 

I guess the point is, I chose to pursue software development because I’m passionate about it. It gives me the same sense of happiness and accomplishment that writing has throughout my life. I wake up every day excited to learn, create and persevere.
